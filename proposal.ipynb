    "According to the OIG (the Office of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services), <b>every year 3000-4000</b> healthcare practitioners have their medical licenses revoked. This project attempts to find out what differentiates the offending healthcare practitioners from the non-offending ones as it relates to prescribing controlled prescription medications. Also, the project will attempt to leverage various machine learning algorthms to predict the likelyhood of a healthcare practioner in losing their medical licence.\n",

In addition to an online search tool, they have a flat file database avaialable for dowload. The records go back to 1977 and the most recent file is about 12.6MB. </br>\n",

The Prescriber data sets for 2013-2016 years are available as flat files and range anywhere from 500-600MB for each year. Information contained in these record can be easily joined with the data from OIG as they both share multiple common fields such as first, last, or business name of the health practioner, their address and a National Provider Identifier or NPI - a unique 10-digit identification number issued to health care providers in the United States by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n",

A quick look through their data revealed that most of their data-sets are from police departments nationwide. This is exactly what I was looking for to incorporate into my model so I can norrow down the geographical regions where offending health practitioners operate.\n",

    "<b>Description:</b> A common measure of liquidity is a bid-ask spread. The higher the liquidity, the lower the spread and vice-versa. Typically, small-caps will have lower liquidity than large-caps. Currently, there are 3667 publicily traded US companies and on any given day, only 15-20% of them will have published option chains. Therefore, if you hold a long position in a small biotech company you may not be able to implement a covered-call hedging strategy.

A couple of days later, we connected and he told me that he's developing a card game and wanted me to help him figure out how fair the game is. Although, I could leverage a combination of python programing, statistics, and read-up on game theory to help him out, this project doesn't have the data component. Therefore, this project isn't a viable data-science project as I had initially hoped. :-("
